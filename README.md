React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.

React Query provides the useQuery hook for fetching data, which accepts a unique query key and an asynchronous function that brings the data. The hook returns an object containing the status, data, and error, among other properties.

**React Query provides:**

* An intuitive API for fetching data from RESTful or GraphQL APIs.
* Caching the results.
* Automatically updating the data when needed.

**Mutations and Updating Data:**

React Query makes updating data simple with the useMutation hook, which allows for easy handling of server mutations and local data updates.

The useMutation hook accepts an asynchronous function that performs the mutation, returning an object containing the mutation status, error, and a function to trigger the mutation.
